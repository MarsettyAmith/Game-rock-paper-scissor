# Game-rock-paper-scissor
Rock Paper Scissors is a classic two-player game where each player chooses one of three possible options: rock, paper, or scissors.
The winner is determined by the rules:
Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock
In this game, you will be playing against the computer. The computer will choose its option randomly, 
and you will be prompted to enter your choice.
To implement this game in Python, you can start by importing the "random" module to generate the computer's choice.
